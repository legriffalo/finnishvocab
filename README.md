# 👋 Hei, welcome to my Finnish vocab repo

## 📝 Repo Description
This repo is a place where I throw together quick idea/data sets for my attempts to learn the Finnish language.

Ideas from here oftern get moved to other repos to be developed further, some not so much!

Feel free to explore there is a mix of SQL, python, css, HTML, and JS
